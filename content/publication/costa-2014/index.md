abstract: "A Bayesian generative model is presented for recommending interesting items and trustworthy users to the targeted users in social rating networks with asymmetric and directed trust relationships. The proposed model is the first unified approach to the combination of the two recommendation tasks. Within the devised model, each user is associated with two latent-factor vectors, i.e., her susceptibility and expertise. Items are also associated with corresponding latent-factor vector representations. The probabilistic factorization of the rating data and trust relationships is exploited to infer user susceptibility and expertise. Statistical social-network modeling is instead used to constrain the trust relationships from a user to another to be governed by their respective susceptibility and expertise. The inherently ambiguous meaning of unobserved trust relationships between users is suitably disambiguated. An intensive comparative experimentation on real-world social rating networks with trust relationships demonstrates the superior predictive performance of the presented model in terms of RMSE and AUC."
