abstract: "Recent works in Recommender Systems (RS) have investigated the relationships between the prediction accuracy, i.e. the ability of a RS to minimize a cost function (for instance the RMSE measure) in estimating users' preferences, and the accuracy of the recommendation list provided to users. State-of-the-art recommendation algorithms, which focus on the minimization of RMSE, have shown to achieve weak results from the recommendation accuracy perspective, and vice versa. In this work we present a novel Bayesian probabilistic hierarchical approach for users' preference data, which is designed to overcome the limitation of current methodologies and thus to meet both prediction and recommendation accuracy. According to the generative semantics of this technique, each user is modeled as a random mixture over latent factors, which identify users community interests. Each individual user community is then modeled as a mixture of topics, which capture the preferences of the members on a set of items. We provide two different formalization of the basic hierarchical model: BH-Forced focuses on rating prediction, while BH-Free models both the popularity of items and the distribution over item ratings. The combined modeling of item popularity and rating provides a powerful framework for the generation of highly accurate recommendations. An extensive evaluation over two popular benchmark datasets reveals the effectiveness and the quality of the proposed algorithms, showing that BH-Free realizes the most satisfactory compromise between prediction and recommendation accuracy with respect to several state-of-the-art competitors.
