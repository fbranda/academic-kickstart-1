	Abstract = {In this paper we propose a survival factorization
                  framework that models information cascades by tying
                  together social influence patterns, topical
                  structure and temporal dynamics. This is achieved
                  through the introduction of a latent space which
                  encodes: (a) the relevance of an information cascade
                  on a topic; (b) the topical authoritativeness and
                  the susceptibility of each individual involved in
                  the information cascade, and (c) temporal topical
                  patterns. By exploiting the cumulative properties of
                  the survival function and of the likelihood of the
                  model on a given adoption log, which records the
                  observed activation times of users and
                  side-information for each cascade, we show that the
                  inference phase is linear in the number of users and
                  in the number of adoptions. The evaluation on both
                  synthetic and real-world data shows the
                  effectiveness of the model in detecting the
                  interplay between topics and social influence
                  patterns, which ultimately provides high accuracy in
                  predicting users activation times.},

	Abstract = {Fault prediction is an important topic for the
                  industry as, by providing effective methods for
                  predictive maintenance, allows companies to perform
                  important time and cost savings. In this paper we
                  describe an application developed to predict and
                  explain door failures on metro trains. To this end,
                  the aim was twofold: first, devising prediction
                  techniques capable of early detecting door failures
                  from diagnostic data; second, describing failures in
                  terms of properties distinguishing them from normal
                  behavior. Data pre-processing was a complex task
                  aimed at overcoming a number of issues with the
                  dataset, like size, sparsity, bias, burst effect and
                  trust. Since failure premonitory signals did not
                  share common patterns, but were only characterized
                  as non-normal device signals, fault prediction was
                  performed by using outlier detection. Fault
                  explanation was finally achieved by exhibiting
                  device features showing abnormal values. An
                  experimental evaluation was performed to assess the
                  quality of the proposed approach. Results show that
                  high-degree outliers are effective indicators of
                  incipient failures. Also, explanation in terms of
                  abnormal feature values (responsible for
                  outlierness) seems to be quite expressive.There are
                  some aspects in the proposed approach that deserve
                  particular attention. We introduce a general
                  framework for the failure detection problem based on
                  an abstract model of diagnostic data, along with a
                  formal problem statement. They both provide the
                  basis for the definition of an effective data
                  pre-processing technique where the behavior of a
                  device, in a given time frame, is summarized through
                  a number of suitable statistics. This approach
                  strongly mitigates the issues related to data
                  errors/noise, thus enabling to perform an effective
                  outlier detection. All this, in our view, provides
                  the grounds of a general methodology for advanced
                  prognostic systems.},

	Abstract = {The outlying property detection problem (OPDP) is
                  the problem of discovering the properties
                  distinguishing a given object, known in advance to
                  be an outlier in a database, from the other database
                  objects. This problem has been recently analyzed
                  focusing on categorical attributes only. However,
                  numerical attributes are very relevant and widely
                  used in databases. Therefore, in this paper, we
                  analyze the OPDP within a context where also
                  numerical attributes are taken into account, which
                  represents a relevant case left open in the
                  literature. As major contributions, we present an
                  efficient parameter-free algorithm to compute the
                  measure of object exceptionality we introduce, and
                  propose a unified framework for mining exceptional
                  properties in the presence of both categorical and
                  numerical attributes.},

                  networks and its exploitation for viral marketing
                  purposes has recently received a large deal of
                  attention. However, regardless of the fact that
                  users authoritativeness, expertise, trust and

                  largely overlooked this aspect. In this article, we
                  study social influence from a topic modeling
                  perspective. We introduce novel topic-aware
                  influence-driven propagation models that, as we show
                  in our experiments, are more accurate in describing
                  real-world cascades than the standard (i.e.,
                  topic-blind) propagation models studied in the
                  literature. In particular, we first propose simple
                  We study the problem of detecting social communities
                  when the social graph is not available but instead
                  we have access to a log of user activity, that is, a
                  dataset of tuples (u, i, t) recording the fact that
                  user u ``adopted'' item i at time t. We propose a
                  stochastic framework that assumes that the adoption
                  of items is governed by an underlying diffusion
                  process over the unobserved social network and that
                  such a diffusion model is based on community-level
                  influence. That is, we aim at modeling communities
                  through the lenses of social contagion. By fitting
                  the model parameters to the user activity log, we
                  learn the community membership and the level of
                  influence of each user in each community. The
                  general framework is instantiated with two different
                  diffusion models, one with discrete time and one
                  with continuous time, and we show that the
                  computational complexity of both approaches is
                  linear in the number of users and in the size of the
                  propagation log. Experiments on synthetic data with
                  planted community structure show that our methods
                  outperform non-trivial baselines. The effectiveness
                  of the proposed techniques is further validated on
                  real-word data, on which our methods are able to
                  detect high-quality communities.},

	Abstract = {A Knowledge Discovery (KD) process is a complex
                  inter-disciplinary task, where di↵erent types of
                  techniques coexist and cooperate for the purpose of
                  extract- ing useful knowledge from large amounts of
                  data. So, it is desirable having a unifying
                  environment, built on a formal basis, where to
                  design and perform the overall process. In this

                  sectors are making significant advances in their
                  customer relations, product selection and
                  development and consequent profitability through
                  using this valuable commodity. Small and medium
                  enterprises (SMEs) have proved themselves to be slow
                  adopters of the new technology of big data analytics
                  and are in danger of being left behind. In Europe,
                  SMEs are a vital part of the economy, and the
                  challenges they encounter need to be addressed as a
                  matter of urgency. This paper identifies barriers to
                  SME uptake of big data analytics and recognises
                  their complex challenge to all stakeholders,
                  including national and international policy makers,
                  IT, business management and data science
                  communities.  The paper proposes a big data maturity
                  model for SMEs as a first step towards an SME
                  roadmap to data analytics. It considers the
                  `state-of-the-art' of IT with respect to usability
                  and usefulness for SMEs and discusses how SMEs can
                  overcome the barriers preventing them from adopting
                  existing solutions. The paper then considers
                  management perspectives and the role of maturity
                  models in enhancing and structuring the adoption of
                  data analytics in an organisation. The history of
                  total quality management is reviewed to inform the
                  core aspects of implanting a new paradigm. The paper
                  concludes with recommendations to help SMEs develop
                  their big data capability and enable them to

                  influence and relevance under a topic-aware
                  perspective. Instead of considering user-to-user
                  influence, the proposed model focuses on user
                  authoritativeness and interests in a topic, leading
                  to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters
                  of the model. We devise methods to learn the
                  parameters of the models from a data set of past
                  propagations. Our experimentation confirms the high

	Abstract = {Probabilistic topic models are widely used in
                  different contexts to uncover the hidden structure
                  in large text corpora. One of the main (and perhaps
                  strong) assumption of these models is that
                  generative process follows a bag-of-words
                  assumption, i.e. each token is independent from the
                  previous one. We extend the popular Latent Dirichlet
                  Allocation model by exploiting three different
                  conditional Markovian assumptions: (i) the token
                  generation depends on the current topic and on the
                  previous token; (ii) the topic associated with each
                  observation depends on topic associated with the
                  previous one; (iii) the token generation depends on
                  the current and previous topic. For each of these
                  modeling assumptions we present a Gibbs Sampling

	Abstract = {Clustering XML documents by structure is the task of
                  grouping them by common structural
                  components. Hitherto, this has been accomplished by
                  looking at the occurrence of one preestablished type
                  of structural components in the structures of the
                  XML documents. However, the a-priori chosen
                  structural components may not be the most
                  appropriate for effective clustering. Moreover, it
                  is likely that the resulting clusters exhibit a
                  certain extent of inner structural inhomogeneity,
                  because of uncaught differences in the structures of
                  the XML documents, due to further neglected forms of
                  structural components.  To overcome these
                  limitations, a new hierarchical approach is
                  proposed, that allows to consider (if necessary)
                  multiple forms of structural components to isolate
                  structurally-homogeneous clusters of XML
                  documents. At each level of the resulting hierarchy,
                  clusters are divided by considering some type of
                  structural components (unaddressed at the preceding
                  levels), that still differentiate the structures of
                  the XML documents. Each cluster in the hierarchy is
                  summarized through a novel technique, that provides
                  a clear and differentiated understanding of its
                  structural properties.  A comparative evaluation
                  over both real and synthetic XML data proves that
                  the devised approach outperforms established
                  competitors in effectiveness and
                  scalability. Cluster summarization is also shown to
                  be very representative.},

                  of rule-based classification under unbalanced and
                  highly imprecise domains. Both models are
                  probabilistic frameworks aimed to boost the
                  performance of basic rule-based classifiers. The
                  first model implements a global-to-local scheme,
                  where the response of a global rule-based classifier
                  is refined by performing a probabilistic analysis of
                  the coverage of its rules. In particular, the
                  coverage of the individual rules is used to learn
                  local probabilistic models, which ultimately refine
                  the predictions from the corresponding rules of the
                  global classifier. The second model implements a
                  dual local-to-global strategy, in which single
                  classification rules are combined within an
                  exponential probabilistic model in order to boost
                  the overall performance as a side effect of mutual
                  influence. Several variants of the basic ideas are

                  the same real-world entity. The problem is
                  approached from a clustering perspective: given a
                  set of tuples, the objective is to partition them
                  into groups of duplicate tuples. Each newly arrived
                  tuple is assigned to an appropriate cluster via
                  nearest-neighbor classifi- cation. This is achieved
                  by means of a suitable hash-based index, that maps
                  any tuple to a set of indexing keys and assigns
                  tuples with high syntactic similarity to the same
                  buckets. Hence, the neighbors of a query tuple can

                  the query tuple itself, without completely scanning

                  phase, the number of clusters is fixed, and an
                  attempt to optimize cluster assignments is done. On
                  the basis of such features, the algorithm attempts

                  in the paper by proposing and analyzing two

                  information about the structure of the control-flow

                  effort is currently devoted to support the storage
                  and retrieval of large collections of such
                  documents. XML documents can be compared as to their
                  structural similarity, in order to group them into
                  clusters so that different storage, retrieval, and
                  processing techniques can be effectively
                  exploited. In this scenario, an efficient and
                  effective similarity function is the key of a
                  successful data management process. We present an
                  approach for detecting structural similarity between
                  XML documents which significantly differs from
                  standard methods based on graph-matching algorithms,
                  and allows a significant reduction of the required
                  computation costs. Our proposal roughly consists of
                  linearizing the structure of each XML document, by

                  comparing such sequences through the analysis of
                  their frequencies. First, some basic strategies for
                  encoding a document are proposed, which can focus on
                  diverse structural facets. Moreover, the theory of

                  effectively and efficiently compare the encoded
                  documents (i.e., signals) in the domain of

                  workflows which has so far not received much
                  attention even though it is crucial for the
                  forthcoming scenarios of large scale applications on
                  the Web: Providing facilities for the human system
                  administrator for identifying the choices performed
                  more frequently in the past that had lead to a
                  desired final configuration. In this context, we
                  formalize the problem of discovering the most
                  frequent patterns of executions, i.e., the workflow
                  substructures that have been scheduled more
                  frequently by the system. We attacked the problem by
                  developing two data mining algorithms on the basis
                  of an intuitive and original graph formalization of
                  a workflow schema and its occurrences. The model is
                  used both to prove some intractability results that
                  strongly motivate the use of data mining techniques
                  and to derive interesting structural properties for
                  reducing the search space for frequent
                  patterns. Indeed, the experiments we have carried
                  out show that our algorithms outperform standard
                  data mining algorithms adapted to discover frequent
                  patterns of workflow executions.},
